# ENGINE-TESTER Performance Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of engine-tester engine performance data

**Repository:** [engine-tester](https://github.com/pssnyder/engine-tester)

## Overview

This analysis examines the performance data from the engine-tester chess engine, tracking metrics and trends throughout the development process.

## Data Sources

The analysis draws from the following data files:

- `analytics_and_dashboard/dashboard/data/behavioral_analysis.json`
- `engines/Opponents/advanced/ElectricShockwaveGambit_Bot_303_metadata.json`
- `gauntlet_testing/v7p3r_stockfish_gauntlet_20250823_230947.json`
- `engines/Copycat/Copycat_v1.0/_internal/jsonschema_specifications/schemas/draft201909/metaschema.json`
- `automated_battle_framework/battle_results/Simple_Test_battle_1756001070.json`
- `engines/Copycat_v1.0/_internal/results/player_stats.json`
- `engines/Copycat/Copycat_v1.0/_internal/results/analysis_summary.json`
- `man_vs_machine_scoreboard/dashboard/data/mvm_analysis.json`
- `analytics_and_dashboard/analysis_results/comparison_results/version_comparison_SlowMate_v1.0_vs_v2.0_20250820_230300.json`
- `analytics_and_dashboard/dashboard/data/results_appendix.json`
- ... and 122 more files

## Analysis Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- **Load and examine** performance test results
- **Visualize trends** in engine performance over time
- **Identify patterns** in optimization efforts
- **Compare metrics** across different engine versions
- **Generate insights** for future development priorities

## Key Metrics

The engine-tester engine performance analysis typically includes:

- **Search Speed**: Nodes per second evaluation
- **Search Depth**: Average and maximum depth reached
- **Move Quality**: Tactical accuracy and positional understanding
- **Time Management**: Efficiency in time allocation
- **Memory Usage**: Resource utilization patterns

## Interactive Analysis

```python
# Sample analysis code
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path

# Set up plotting style for dark theme
plt.style.use('dark_background')
sns.set_palette('viridis')

print('Analysis notebook for engine-tester engine')
```

## Results Summary

This section will be populated with findings once the analysis is executed.

### Performance Trends
