# C0BR4 Performance Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of c0br4 engine performance data

**Repository:** [c0br4](https://github.com/pssnyder/c0br4)

## Overview

This analysis examines the performance data from the c0br4 chess engine, tracking metrics and trends throughout the development process.

## Data Sources

The analysis draws from the following data files:

- `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/win-x64/ChessAI_v1.2.deps.json`
- `src/obj/project.assets.json`
- `src/obj/ChessEngine.csproj.nuget.dgspec.json`
- `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/win-x64/ChessAI_v1.2.runtimeconfig.json`
- `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/ChessAI_v0.3.runtimeconfig.json`
- `backups/dist_backup_20250817_172447/v0.3/ChessAI_v0.3.runtimeconfig.json`
- `src/obj/C0BR4ChessEngine.csproj.nuget.dgspec.json`
- `backups/src_backup_20250817_172446/obj/project.assets.json`
- `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/win-x64/ChessAI_v2.0.deps.json`
- `src/obj/Release/net6.0/win-x64/ChessAI_v1.2.deps.json`
- ... and 33 more files

## Analysis Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- **Load and examine** performance test results
- **Visualize trends** in engine performance over time
- **Identify patterns** in optimization efforts
- **Compare metrics** across different engine versions
- **Generate insights** for future development priorities

## Key Metrics

The c0br4 engine performance analysis typically includes:

- **Search Speed**: Nodes per second evaluation
- **Search Depth**: Average and maximum depth reached
- **Move Quality**: Tactical accuracy and positional understanding
- **Time Management**: Efficiency in time allocation
- **Memory Usage**: Resource utilization patterns

## Interactive Analysis

```python
# Sample analysis code
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path

# Set up plotting style for dark theme
plt.style.use('dark_background')
sns.set_palette('viridis')

print('Analysis notebook for c0br4 engine')
```

## Results Summary

This section will be populated with findings once the analysis is executed.

### Performance Trends
