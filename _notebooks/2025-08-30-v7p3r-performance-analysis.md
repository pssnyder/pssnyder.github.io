# V7P3R Performance Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of v7p3r engine performance data

**Repository:** [v7p3r](https://github.com/pssnyder/v7p3r)

## Overview

This analysis examines the performance data from the v7p3r chess engine, tracking metrics and trends throughout the development process.

## Data Sources

The analysis draws from the following data files:

- `releases/v3.0/configs/rulesets/custom_rulesets.json`
- `versions/v2.4/.markdownlint.json`
- `builds/v7p3r_chess_engine_gen_2/v0.6.30_v7p3r_engine/v7p3r_engine/saved_configs/default_config.json`
- `builds/v7p3r_chess_engine_gen_3/v0.7.14_v7p3r_engine/config.json`
- `builds/v7p3r_chess_engine_gen_3/v0.7.07_v7p3r_engine/docs/.markdownlint.json`
- `builds/v0.6.30_beta-candidate-10_COMPLETE/EXTRACTION_INFO.json`
- `versions/v2.5/v7p3r_engine/saved_configs/config_template.json`
- `builds/v7p3r_chess_engine_gen_3/v0.7.25_v7p3r_engine/config_speed.json`
- `builds_complete/v0.7.7_beta-candidate-9_COMPLETE/configs/test_config.json`
- `builds/v0.6.30_beta-candidate-10/EXTRACTION_INFO.json`
- ... and 613 more files

## Analysis Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- **Load and examine** performance test results
- **Visualize trends** in engine performance over time
- **Identify patterns** in optimization efforts
- **Compare metrics** across different engine versions
- **Generate insights** for future development priorities

## Key Metrics

The v7p3r engine performance analysis typically includes:

- **Search Speed**: Nodes per second evaluation
- **Search Depth**: Average and maximum depth reached
- **Move Quality**: Tactical accuracy and positional understanding
- **Time Management**: Efficiency in time allocation
- **Memory Usage**: Resource utilization patterns

## Interactive Analysis

```python
# Sample analysis code
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path

# Set up plotting style for dark theme
plt.style.use('dark_background')
sns.set_palette('viridis')

print('Analysis notebook for v7p3r engine')
```

## Results Summary

This section will be populated with findings once the analysis is executed.
