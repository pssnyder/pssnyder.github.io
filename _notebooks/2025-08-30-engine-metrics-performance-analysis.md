# ENGINE-METRICS Performance Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of engine-metrics engine performance data

**Repository:** [engine-metrics](https://github.com/pssnyder/engine-metrics)

## Overview

This analysis examines the performance data from the engine-metrics chess engine, tracking metrics and trends throughout the development process.

## Data Sources

The analysis draws from the following data files:

- `frontend/node_modules/jest-runtime/node_modules/jest-mock/package.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/loader/options.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/postcss-svgo/node_modules/mdn-data/css/units.schema.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/.cache/babel-loader/5c21d3522a18212d15df282644478d7c177416eb4143e66eae101b23d73340c9.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/dom-accessibility-api/package.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/@babel/plugin-transform-named-capturing-groups-regex/package.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/workbox-build/node_modules/ajv/dist/refs/json-schema-2019-09/meta/core.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/is-weakref/tsconfig.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/.cache/babel-loader/33b78c124e1d2d6bd664b5433f8c2fc70a5f04a80c78d309b4271bdca13951f6.json`
- `frontend/node_modules/eslint-plugin-react/node_modules/resolve/test/resolver/baz/package.json`
- ... and 2604 more files

## Analysis Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- **Load and examine** performance test results
- **Visualize trends** in engine performance over time
- **Identify patterns** in optimization efforts
- **Compare metrics** across different engine versions
- **Generate insights** for future development priorities

## Key Metrics

The engine-metrics engine performance analysis typically includes:

- **Search Speed**: Nodes per second evaluation
- **Search Depth**: Average and maximum depth reached
- **Move Quality**: Tactical accuracy and positional understanding
- **Time Management**: Efficiency in time allocation
- **Memory Usage**: Resource utilization patterns

## Interactive Analysis

```python
# Sample analysis code
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path

# Set up plotting style for dark theme
plt.style.use('dark_background')
sns.set_palette('viridis')

print('Analysis notebook for engine-metrics engine')
```

## Results Summary

This section will be populated with findings once the analysis is executed.

### Performance Trends
