# SLOWMATE Performance Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of slowmate engine performance data

**Repository:** [slowmate](https://github.com/pssnyder/slowmate)

## Overview

This analysis examines the performance data from the slowmate chess engine, tracking metrics and trends throughout the development process.

## Data Sources

The analysis draws from the following data files:

- `builds/SlowMate_v0.1.02_Beta/data/endgames/tactical_setups.json`
- `builds/SlowMate_v0.0.3_Opening_Book/data/openings/preferences.json`
- `results/enhanced_engine_stats.json`
- `data/endgames/pawn_endings.json`
- `builds/v0.1.03/data/endgames/mate_patterns.json`
- `builds/SlowMate_v0.0.3_Opening_Book/data/openings/mainlines.json`
- `builds/v0.2.0/data/endgames/mate_patterns.json`
- `data/openings/mainlines_enhanced.json`
- `builds/v0.1.02/data/endgames/mate_patterns.json`
- `data/openings/sidelines.json`
- ... and 69 more files

## Analysis Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- **Load and examine** performance test results
- **Visualize trends** in engine performance over time
- **Identify patterns** in optimization efforts
- **Compare metrics** across different engine versions
- **Generate insights** for future development priorities

## Key Metrics

The slowmate engine performance analysis typically includes:

- **Search Speed**: Nodes per second evaluation
- **Search Depth**: Average and maximum depth reached
- **Move Quality**: Tactical accuracy and positional understanding
- **Time Management**: Efficiency in time allocation
- **Memory Usage**: Resource utilization patterns

## Interactive Analysis

```python
# Sample analysis code
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path

# Set up plotting style for dark theme
plt.style.use('dark_background')
sns.set_palette('viridis')

print('Analysis notebook for slowmate engine')
```

## Results Summary

This section will be populated with findings once the analysis is executed.

### Performance Trends

- Engine performance progression over development timeline
- Impact of major algorithm changes
- Optimization effectiveness

### Recommendations

Based on the performance data analysis:
