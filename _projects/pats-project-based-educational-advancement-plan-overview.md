# **Project-Based Educational Advancement Plan DRAFT**

## **Vision Statement**

To achieve a master's or doctorate degree by leveraging an existing project as a career capstone, thereby demonstrating a high level of expertise and providing a substantial contribution to the field of computer information systems. This path prioritizes hands-on, self-directed research and learning over traditional classroom instruction.

## **Core Principles**

* **Self-Directed Learning:** The learning process is driven by independent research and the needs of the project, free from the time and content constraints of a traditional curriculum.  
* **Applied Knowledge:** The focus is on applying theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem, resulting in a tangible and valuable solution.  
* **Efficiency:** This approach aims to minimize the time and financial overhead typically associated with higher education.  
* **Modern Tooling:** Acknowledge and embrace the use of artificial intelligence as an augmentation tool for research, data analysis, and presentation to maximize impact and reach.

### **Project Scope**

* **Project Idea:** A comprehensive exploration of human-augmented decision-making, from its historical roots to modern-day applications, with a focus on psychological and societal barriers to trust and adoption. The project will culminate in a framework for ethical and effective human-AI collaboration.  
* **Problem Statement:** The exponential growth of AI tooling has created a fundamental divide in trust, driven by a lack of understanding. This manifests as a spectrum of negative outcomes, including:  
  * **Uncritical Trust:** Users who trust the tools without understanding their limitations.  
  * **Fear and Misunderstanding:** Individuals who perceive AI as an existential threat, creating an emotional barrier to adoption.  
  * **AI Guilt:** A particularly interesting subgroup that sees the value in AI but is psychologically or socially throttled by the perception of "cheating," leading to a plateau in their personal technological advancement.  
* **Methodology:** The project will be conducted through a multi-faceted approach:  
  * **Historical Analysis:** A research journey into the evolution of programmatic and automated decision-making, from early concepts like Turing machines to the development of early chess engines.  
  * **Hands-on Development:** Continuous, iterative development of personal AI projects (e.g., chess engines) to serve as a living laboratory for data collection and practical insights.  
  * **Theoretical Exploration:** A deep dive into "truncated branches" of theory, exploring avenues of research that were previously abandoned or underdeveloped due to historical limitations.  
  * **AI as a Research Tool:** The project will lean into the unencumbered use of AI for augmenting human research, including data synthesis, complex analysis, and the creation of compelling visualizations and narratives for the final capstone thesis.  
* **Expected Contribution:** This project is intended to make a significant contribution in the following ways:  
  * **A New Framework:** Propose a new, nuanced framework for understanding the human psychology of AI adoption and decision augmentation, helping to identify and dismantle the psychological barriers that lead to fear and guilt.  
  * **Substantiated Data:** Provide a rich body of data and real-world insights from the hands-on projects, demonstrating the capabilities and ethical considerations of human-AI decision-making.  
  * **A Call to Action:** The final capstone thesis will serve as both an educational journey and a guide for the community, encouraging a more thoughtful and informed approach to the integration of AI into our daily lives.  
* **Capstone Thesis:** The final presentation and documentation of this project will serve as the capstone thesis. It will include all findings, data, and conclusions, presented in a clear and compelling manner.

## **Potential Avenues for Educational Advancement**

### **1\. Professional Doctorates**

* **Focus:** Applied research for working professionals.  
* **Degree Titles:** D.Eng (Doctor of Engineering), D.B.A. (Doctor of Business Administration), Ed.D. (Doctor of Education), etc.  
* **Fit:** Highly aligned with your goals. These programs are designed for individuals who want to apply a scholarly approach to solving practical problems in their industry. The culminating dissertation or capstone project is often a practice-based study of your own work.

### **2\. Individualized/Interdisciplinary Programs**

* **Focus:** Creating a custom degree plan.  
* **Degree Titles:** Master of Arts (M.A.) in Individualized Studies, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Interdisciplinary Studies.  
* **Fit:** Provides the flexibility to design a curriculum around your specific project and a thesis committee that is well-suited to evaluating your work. This is a good option if your project spans multiple traditional academic disciplines.

## **Action Plan**

1. **Refine the Project:** Formally document the problem statement, methodology, and expected outcomes of your project.  
2. **Identify Target Programs:** Research universities offering professional doctorates or individualized programs that align with your field (e.g., computer science, data science, information systems).  
3. **Contact Faculty/Advisors:** Reach out to faculty members in these programs to discuss your vision and see if they would be a good fit to supervise your research.  
4. **Prepare for Application:** Begin compiling a portfolio of your work and a formal proposal for your capstone thesis project.

## **Your Personal "Why"**

* **Problem-Solving:** This is a direct application of your life motto: "Solve. The. Problem."  
* **Efficiency:** Focuses your energy on what truly matters—the project itself—without the overhead of unnecessary coursework.  
* **Empowerment:** Embraces a learning style that empowers you to explore, discover, and use modern tools to their full potential, free from traditional academic constraints.
