# This file contains the complete, high-level overview of the Project-Based Educational Capstone,
# combining documentation and placeholder code for a cohesive single source of truth.

# ---
# 1. The Core Idea
# To achieve a master's or doctorate degree by leveraging an existing project as a career capstone, thereby demonstrating a high level of expertise and providing a substantial contribution to the field of computer information systems. This path prioritizes hands-on, self-directed research and learning over traditional classroom instruction.
# ---

# 2. Project Scope
#
# Project Idea:
# A comprehensive exploration of human-augmented decision-making, from its historical roots to modern-day applications, with a focus on psychological and societal barriers to trust and adoption. The project will culminate in a framework for ethical and effective human-AI collaboration.
#
# Problem Statement:
# The exponential growth of AI tooling has created a fundamental divide in trust, driven by a lack of understanding. This manifests as a spectrum of negative outcomes, including uncritical trust, fear and misunderstanding, and "AI Guilt" which throttles individual advancement.
#
# Methodology:
# This project will be conducted through a multi-faceted approach:
# 1. Historical Analysis: A research journey into the evolution of programmatic and automated decision-making.
# 2. Hands-on Development: Continuous, iterative development of personal AI projects (e.g., chess engines) to serve as a living laboratory for data collection and practical insights.
# 3. Theoretical Exploration: A deep dive into "truncated branches" of theory, exploring previously abandoned avenues of research.
# 4. AI as a Research Tool: The project will lean into the unencumbered use of AI for augmenting human research, including data synthesis, complex analysis, and the creation of compelling visualizations.
#
# Expected Contribution:
# This project is intended to make a significant contribution in the following ways:
# * A New Framework: Propose a new, nuanced framework for understanding the human psychology of AI adoption and decision augmentation.
# * Substantiated Data: Provide a rich body of data and real-world insights from the hands-on projects, demonstrating the capabilities and ethical considerations of human-AI decision-making.
# * A Call to Action: The final capstone thesis will serve as both an educational journey and a guide for the community, encouraging a more thoughtful and informed approach to the integration of AI into our daily lives.

# This is where we'll place our code, data analysis, and visualizations as we build out the findings for Section VI of the thesis outline.

# Placeholder for data loading and initial exploration
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data from a CSV file (assuming you have one)
# df = pd.read_csv('chess_engine_data.csv')

# Example: Display basic statistics
# print(df.describe())

# Example: Analyze a specific metric, such as decision-making speed vs. complexity
# df['decision_time'] = ...
# df['complexity_score'] = ...
# correlation = df['decision_time'].corr(df['complexity_score'])
# print(f"Correlation between decision time and complexity: {correlation}")

# Instructions for Data Analysis
"""
Objective: To analyze the data collected from the chess engine project to identify patterns in human-AI decision-making and validate the hypotheses outlined in the problem statement.

Input Data: The raw data from your chess engine, which might include:
  * Game logs (moves, timestamps)
  * Decision metrics (e.g., search depth, number of nodes evaluated)
  * User feedback or emotional state (if collected)
  * AI model parameters (e.g., engine settings, complexity level)

Task List:
  1. Data Ingestion: Load the raw data into a pandas DataFrame.
  2. Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values or inconsistent data types.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use descriptive statistics and initial plots to understand the data's distribution.
  4. Feature Engineering: Create new metrics to test your hypotheses, such as "trust score" or "AI reliance."
  5. Hypothesis Testing: Run statistical tests to find correlations between variables, for example, between a user's decision-making speed and the AI's "complexity score."
  6. Visualization: Create compelling plots and charts to illustrate your findings for the thesis.

# Placeholder for a dummy visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# The following code is commented out as it is a placeholder until real data is available.
#
# # Example: Create a scatter plot to visualize decision time vs. complexity
# # plt.scatter(df['complexity_score'], df['decision_time'])
# # plt.title('Decision Time vs. Complexity')
# # plt.xlabel('Complexity Score')
# # plt.ylabel('Decision Time (ms)')
